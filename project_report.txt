Project Report: Classic Models Sales Management System
=================================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project is a data migration and mapping system that converts a relational database (MySQL) into an object-oriented database structure using JSON format. The main objective is to demonstrate and implement the transformation of traditional relational database data into a modern object-oriented format while maintaining data integrity and relationships.

Database Structure
-----------------
The system implements a comprehensive sales management database with the following entities:

1. Offices
   - Primary key: officeCode
   - Contains office location and contact information
   - Manages multiple employees

2. Employees
   - Primary key: employeeNumber
   - Foreign key: officeCode (references Offices)
   - Tracks employee information and hierarchy
   - Can be assigned to multiple customers

3. Customers
   - Primary key: customerNumber
   - Foreign key: salesRepEmployeeNumber (references Employees)
   - Stores customer information and credit limits
   - Can place multiple orders and make multiple payments

4. Products
   - Primary key: productCode
   - Foreign key: productLine (references ProductLines)
   - Contains product details, inventory, and pricing
   - Can be included in multiple order details

5. Product Lines
   - Primary key: productLine
   - Categorizes products into different lines
   - Contains descriptions and images

6. Orders
   - Primary key: orderNumber
   - Foreign key: customerNumber (references Customers)
   - Tracks order status and shipping information
   - Can contain multiple order details

7. Order Details
   - Composite key: orderNumber + productCode
   - Foreign keys: orderNumber (references Orders), productCode (references Products)
   - Contains quantity and price information for each product in an order

8. Payments
   - Composite key: customerNumber + checkNumber
   - Foreign key: customerNumber (references Customers)
   - Tracks payment history and amounts

Implementation Details
---------------------
1. Data Migration Approach:
   - Source: MySQL relational database
   - Target: JSON-based object database
   - Transformation: Relational to Object mapping
   - Validation: Data integrity checks during migration

2. Technical Implementation:
   - Language: Java
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Key Features:
     * Composite key handling
     * Relationship preservation
     * Data type conversion
     * Validation mechanisms

3. Data Integrity:
   - All JSON files are properly formatted
   - No duplicate records in payments.json
   - Relationships between entities are maintained
   - Data types are preserved during migration

4. Migration Process:
   - SQL data extraction
   - Data transformation
   - JSON file generation
   - Relationship mapping
   - Validation and verification

File Sizes and Records
---------------------
Total Project Size: ~250KB
- Source Code: ~30KB
- Resource Files: ~220KB
- SQL Data: Included in project

Record Counts:
- Payments: 273 records
- Other entities: Counts maintained from original database

Recent Changes
-------------
1. Removed duplicate records from payments.json
2. Verified data integrity across all JSON files
3. Validated relationship mappings
4. Ensured proper data type conversion

Recommendations
--------------
1. Data Validation:
   - Implement comprehensive data validation
   - Add data type checking
   - Verify relationship integrity

2. Error Handling:
   - Add robust error handling
   - Implement rollback mechanisms
   - Log migration errors

3. Logging:
   - Add detailed logging
   - Track migration progress
   - Monitor performance

4. Documentation:
   - Document migration process
   - Create API documentation
   - Add usage examples

5. Data Backup:
   - Implement backup procedures
   - Version control for JSON files
   - Recovery mechanisms

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement batch processing
   - Add caching mechanisms
   - Optimize file operations

7. Testing:
   - Add unit tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Create test data sets

Conclusion
----------
This project successfully demonstrates the migration of a relational database to an object-oriented structure using JSON format. The system maintains data integrity, preserves relationships, and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. The recent cleanup of duplicate records in payments.json has improved data quality, and the system is now ready for further development and optimization.

The project serves as a practical example of database migration and mapping, showing how traditional relational data can be effectively transformed into a modern object-oriented format while maintaining data consistency and relationship integrity.
